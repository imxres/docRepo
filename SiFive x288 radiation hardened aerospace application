Yes, it is highly likely that a radiation-hardened version of the SiFive X288 is either available or under development. Here's why:
 * NASA's High-Performance Spaceflight Computing (HPSC) Project: NASA has selected SiFive's RISC-V architecture, specifically utilizing the SiFive X280 cores (the X288 integrates two X280 core complexes), for its next-generation HPSC processor. A key requirement for spaceflight computing is radiation hardening to ensure reliable operation in the harsh space environment.
 * Radiation Hardening Mentioned for HPSC: Documents related to the HPSC project explicitly mention a "Radiation-Hardened Design Approach" and the use of "radiation hardened flip flops and gates." This indicates that the SiFive cores being used in HPSC are being implemented with radiation hardening techniques.
 * SiFive Split-Lock Feature: The SiFive X288 datasheet highlights a "Split-Lock with DCLS (Dual Core Lock Step)" feature, which is specifically mentioned in the context of aerospace applications for redundancy and fault tolerance â€“ crucial aspects for radiation-prone environments.
 * Microchip Partnership: SiFive is partnering with Microchip, which has experience in developing radiation-hardened parts, under a contract with NASA to develop a RISC-V processor for space missions. This collaboration strongly suggests that radiation-hardened versions of SiFive's cores, including those present in the X288, are a key objective.
 * PIC64-HPSC Series: Microchip has announced the PIC64-HPSC series, which includes radiation-hardened and radiation-tolerant variants for space missions, utilizing SiFive X288/X280. These variants cater to different mission profiles with varying levels of radiation tolerance.
In summary, while SiFive's general product page for the X288 might not explicitly state "radiation hardened," its selection by NASA for a spaceflight computer with radiation hardening requirements, the inclusion of fault-tolerant features like Split-Lock DCLS, and the partnership with Microchip for space-grade RISC-V processors strongly indicate the availability or near-term availability of radiation-hardened X288 variants.
For definitive information on specific radiation-hardened X288 products and their specifications, it is best to:
 * Contact SiFive directly through their sales or technical support channels.
 * Look for announcements or product briefs related to the NASA HPSC project or SiFive's aerospace offerings.
 * Check Microchip's website for details on their PIC64-HPSC series.
