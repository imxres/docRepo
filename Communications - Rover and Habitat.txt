Based on the sources, normal communications used on rovers and habitats involve a combination of radio frequency communication and the development of more advanced technologies like optical (laser) communications and Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN).

For rovers, such as the Perseverance Mars rover, communication typically relies on radio waves. These rovers can communicate directly with Earth, but due to the vast distances, this can be slow and subject to disruptions. Therefore, orbiting relay satellites, like the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), often play a crucial role in relaying commands from Earth to the landers and rovers on the Martian surface and returning science and engineering data back to Earth. MRO is equipped with an ultra-high-frequency (UHF) radio for this purpose. The large 3-meter radio antenna dish on MRO is essential for these communications.
For habitats, such as the planned Gateway lunar space station, reliable communication is also paramount. The Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) of Gateway will be crucial for enabling telecommunications between the lunar surface, the space station, Earth, and back again. NASA is also developing and implementing key communication and navigation technologies to support robust exploration at and near the Moon, which would likely include habitats. This includes the use of GPS signals for navigation and the development of optical communications technology to allow multi-gigabit data connections back to Earth.

A significant challenge in deep space communication is the delay and potential for disruption or data loss due to the extreme distances. To address this, NASA is developing Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN), which aims to create a "Solar System Internet" with automated data delivery between users regardless of distance or intermittent connections.

Another key advancement is in optical communications. The Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD) and the Deep Space Optical Communications (DSOC) package aboard the Psyche mission are examples of NASA's efforts to utilize laser light to encode and transmit data. Optical communications technologies have the potential to dramatically improve data rates between spacecraft and Earth, offering 10 to 100 times better performance than radio communications. Gateway will also rely on advancements from missions like Psyche that have used electric propulsion technology, suggesting a potential link to advanced communication systems as well.

Furthermore, NASA is also exploring the concept of LunaNet, a scalable communications and navigation network for the Moon, which would establish a framework of standards and protocols to support seamless robotic and human operations, including habitats. This network envisions rovers and astronauts on the lunar surface having network access similar to Earth, allowing for efficient data transfer and real-time alerts.
In summary, the normal communications for rovers and habitats involve established radio frequency systems, often utilizing relay orbiters for efficiency on distant bodies like Mars. Simultaneously, NASA is actively developing and planning to implement advanced technologies such as optical communications and Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking to enhance the capabilities and reliability of communication for future rovers and habitats in deep space. The development of network architectures like LunaNet also indicates a move towards more integrated and robust communication infrastructures for sustained lunar operations.
