While SiFive offers a range of "Intelligence" processors designed for AI and ML workloads, precise and detailed specifications for each specific model can vary and are often made available through their product briefs and datasheets.
However, based on the provided search results, here's a general overview of the specifications and key features you can expect from the SiFive Intelligence processor family:
General Features of SiFive Intelligence Processors:
 * RISC-V Architecture: All SiFive Intelligence processors are based on the open-standard RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), offering flexibility and customization.
 * Scalable Vector Compute: They are designed with high-performance scalar and scalable vector compute capabilities to accelerate AI/ML tasks.
 * SiFive Intelligence Extensions: These processors include a suite of custom vector instructions specifically tuned for machine learning operations, such as matrix multiplications (matmuls), and optimized for data types like INT8 and BF16.
 * Vector Processing: They incorporate RISC-V Vector (RVV) extensions, supporting various vector lengths (up to 1024-bit in some models like the X390) and data types (integer, fixed-point, floating-point, including bfloat16).
 * Multi-Core and Multi-Cluster Configurations: Many SiFive Intelligence processors support multi-core and multi-cluster configurations for increased parallel processing capabilities.
 * Memory Subsystem: They feature high-performance memory subsystems, often with private L2 caches for vector units and support for coherent memory access via CHI ports and high-bandwidth ports connected to SRAM.
 * AI/ML Software Optimization: SiFive actively works on optimizing software frameworks like TensorFlow Lite for their Intelligence processors, with many neural network models being ported.
 * VCIX (Vector Coprocessor Interface Extension): Some high-end models like the X390 offer VCIX, allowing customers to add their own custom vector instructions or acceleration hardware.
 * Performance Metrics: Performance is often cited in terms of TOPS (Tera Operations Per Second) for INT8 operations and TFLOPS (Tera Floating Point Operations Per Second) for BF16, as well as standard CPU benchmarks like CoreMarks/MHz, DMIPS/MHz, and SPECint/GHz.
