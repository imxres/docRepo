While both the SiFive X288 and the BAE RAD750 are used in demanding environments, particularly aerospace, they represent very different eras and architectures in processor design. Here's a comparison of their specifications:
SiFive Intelligence X288:
 * Architecture: RISC-V RV64GCV ISA
 * Cores: Multi-core, multi-cluster, up to 8 cores
 * Vector Processing: 512-bit Vector Length (VLEN), Single Vector ALU, RISC-V Vector (RVV) extensions, SiFive Intelligence Extensions for ML workloads
 * Performance: Approximately 4.6 TOPS (INT8), Benchmarks: 5.75 CoreMarks/MHz, 3.25 DMIPS/MHz, 4.6 SpecINT2k6/GHz
 * Memory: Virtual memory support with precise exceptions, up to 48-bit addressing, memory parallelism for cache miss tolerance
 * Interfaces: CXL Host interface
 * Features: Split-Lock with DCLS (Dual Core Lock Step) for redundancy in aerospace applications, optimized TensorFlow Lite implementation, hundreds of neural network models ported
 * Target Applications: Aerospace, AI/ML compute at the edge, infrastructure, object detection, speech and recommendation processing
 * Technology Node: Not explicitly specified in the search results, but likely a modern process node (e.g., 22nm as mentioned for other SiFive products).
BAE RAD750:
 * Architecture: PowerPC 750
 * Cores: Single core
 * Vector Processing: None (it's a general-purpose processor architecture from the late 1990s)
 * Performance: 110 MHz to 200 MHz core clock, >260 Dhrystone 2.1 MIPS at 132 MHz, >400 Dhrystone 2.1 MIPS at 200 MHz
 * Memory: Typically used with external memory; some single-board computer configurations include 128 MB SDRAM with ECC.
 * Interfaces: Varies depending on the single-board computer implementation (e.g., PCI 2.2, SpaceWire, 1553).
 * Features: Radiation hardened for space environments (Total dose: 200 Krad(Si) to 1 Mrad(Si) depending on the version, SEU <1.6 E-10 errors/bit-day), Latchup-immune, wide temperature range (-55°C to +125°C).
 * Target Applications: Onboard satellites and spacecraft, high-radiation environments (it has been used in numerous space missions).
 * Technology Node: Manufactured using either 250 nm or 150 nm photolithography.
Key Differences and Summary:
 * Architecture: The X288 is based on the modern, open-standard RISC-V architecture with vector extensions designed for AI/ML, while the RAD750 uses the PowerPC 750 architecture from the late 1990s.
 * Core Count: The X288 is a multi-core processor, offering significantly more parallel processing capability than the single-core RAD750.
 * Performance: The X288 offers orders of magnitude higher performance, especially for AI/ML tasks, due to its higher clock speeds, multi-core design, and dedicated vector processing units. Performance metrics like TOPS are not applicable to the RAD750 as it lacks the specialized hardware.
 * Vector Processing: The X288 has advanced vector processing capabilities crucial for accelerating AI and signal processing, which are absent in the RAD750.
 * Radiation Hardening: Both processors are designed for harsh environments. The RAD750 is specifically radiation-hardened and has a long flight heritage. The X288, particularly the version with Split-Lock DCLS, is also targeting aerospace with fault-tolerant features.
 * Power Consumption: While specific power figures for the X288 in aerospace configurations aren't readily available, modern RISC-V designs often prioritize power efficiency. The RAD750's power consumption is around 5-12.2 Watts depending on the configuration and speed.
 * Age and Technology: The RAD750 is a mature and well-established processor with extensive use in space, but its underlying technology is significantly older than the modern SiFive X288.
In essence, the SiFive X288 represents a new generation of high-performance, AI-focused processors for demanding applications, including aerospace, while the BAE RAD750 is a reliable, radiation-hardened workhorse with a long history in space missions, based on older but proven technology. The choice between them would depend heavily on the specific requirements of the application, particularly the need for high computational performance (especially for AI/ML), power constraints, and the level of radiation tolerance required.
