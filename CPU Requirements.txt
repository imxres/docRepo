Drawing on the sources and our conversation history, there isn't a single, definitive answer to "what are the CPU requirements for a space mission" because it varies greatly depending on the specific mission, its objectives, the onboard instruments, and the ground-based support needed. However, we can glean some insights:

	*   In our previous discussion about a dual rover mission, it was noted that the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has a computer operating at up to **46 million instructions per second** [Previous Conversation, 17]. Source confirms this, stating that the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has a computer "operating at up to 46 million instructions per second". This provides a historical data point for the processing power of a spacecraft computer involved in a major Mars mission.

	*   The "NCAS Mission 2 Exploration Simulation Handbook.pdf" highlights the importance of **computer systems** in mission design and planning. It outlines the role of a Computer Engineer who is responsible for researching, selecting, and managing these systems for a simulated mission. The handbook also mentions "computer systems cards" which teams will purchase. While this doesn't specify CPU requirements, it underscores that computing power is a fundamental consideration for any space mission, even in the planning stages.

	*   The "Annual Highlights of Results from the International Space Station" mentions the use of an **ISS-certified scanning electron microscope (Mochii)** that reads trace element information. This indicates the presence of sophisticated scientific instruments onboard spacecraft that require processing capabilities to analyze data.

	*   The "Astrophysics Technology Update 2024" and "Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 2020s (2021) - NASA's Cosmic Origins" sources emphasize the critical role of **computation, both in theory and data science**, for essentially every topic in astronomy and astrophysics. These sources discuss the use of complex software for data reduction, analysis, and simulations, often requiring **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** and **High-Throughput Computing (HTC)** resources. For example:
  
  		*   Mechanical and thermal finite element models for the James Webb Space Telescope required "significant amounts of computer power and very 		long run times".
    		*   General-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GR-MHD) codes used for simulations in astrophysics see "large speed increases over CPU-based 		codes" when running on fast GPUs.
    		*   The Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) will have a "flexible signal processing center" for real-time correlation of data.
    		*   Concepts for "radio cameras" like the DSA-2000 envision real-time image production without deconvolution, suggesting substantial 			processing needs.

	*   These sources also highlight the increasing use of **advanced statistical techniques and Machine Learning**, which can require complex codes and significant computational resources for analyzing large datasets.

In summary, while a specific CPU requirement for a space mission isn't provided, the sources and our conversation history illustrate that:

	*   **Onboard processing** is necessary for spacecraft control, operation of scientific instruments, and potentially some level of data analysis, as exemplified by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and instruments on the ISS.
	
	*   **Ground-based computing resources**, including HPC and HTC facilities, are essential for mission planning, complex simulations, and the analysis of the vast amounts of data generated by space missions and astronomical observations.
	
	*   The **complexity and goals of the mission** dictate the necessary computational resources, with more ambitious scientific endeavors and complex instruments likely requiring greater processing power.

Therefore, instead of a fixed CPU requirement, it's more accurate to think of a spectrum of computing needs throughout a space mission's lifecycle, involving both onboard systems and extensive ground-based infrastructure.
